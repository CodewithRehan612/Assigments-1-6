Made by Rehan Aslam

## Features

- Start, stop, and reset functionality
- Visual countdown display
- Audio notification when timer completes
- Modern and clean user interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes with Python installation)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Enter the desired time in hours, minutes, and seconds
3. Click "Start" to begin the countdown
4. Use "Stop" to pause the timer

## How it Works

The application uses tkinter for the graphical user interface and implements a countdown timer that updates every second. When the timer reaches zero, it will display "Time's up!" and play a sound notification.
